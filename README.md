# Hey! I am Abdullah ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught Software Engineer focused on Backend Engineering and Cloud Infrastructure. My current skillset revolves around JavaScript, Go and AWS.

I initially learned to code with C in 2017 and used some C++ after, but only got serious about a career in computer science in 2021. Learned JavaScript to enter the industry and have never looked back.
